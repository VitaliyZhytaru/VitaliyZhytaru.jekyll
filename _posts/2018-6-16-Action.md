A horror film is a film that seeks to elicit fear.[1] Initially inspired by literature from authors like Edgar Allan Poe, Bram Stoker, and Mary Shelley[2], horror has existed as a film genre for more than a century. The macabre and the supernatural are frequent themes. Horror may also overlap with the fantasy, supernatural fiction, and thriller genres.
